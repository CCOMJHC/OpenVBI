# \brief Track packet statistics for the loader/processor
#
# As packets are loaded from the WIBL file, it is often important to keep track of which
# packets have been seen, how often, and how many times each type of packet causes a range
# of potential faults when being processed.  This file provides a couple of classes that
# can be used to track arbitrarily named packets, and provide composite statistics on demand.

# automatically adds new entries to the dictionary as any of the counting methods are called,
# although EnsureName() can be called to explicitly add the entry if required.  The Seen()
# method can be used to determine whether a particular packet has been observed in the data
# stream.  A constant can be specified at instantiation to provide a limit to the number of faults
# that can be seen and still report them (i.e., to avoid too many error messages from being
# issued on the output in verbose mode).  The object here does not mandate this: it just stores
# the constant on behalf of the user so that it doesn't need to get passed around the code.
