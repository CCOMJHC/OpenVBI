# \brief Simple (linear) interpolation structure for arbitrary numbers of dependent variables
#
# Most sources have asynchronous data packets for depths, positions, and other variables, but we need
# to be able to match up positions and real-world times with the observations in order to make
# them into something useful.  Since each data packet also only has a timestamp for when it was
# received (according to the millisecond elapsed-time counter on the logger, or an equivalent),
# we need to be able to interpolate between elapsed times and real-world times available in
# certain packets.  This file provides a simple linear interpolation class that can be used to
# establish a relationship between a single independent variable, and one or more dependent
# variables, and then interpolate to points in a NumPy vector for the independent variable.

## Simple linear interpolation table for one or more dependent variables
#
# In order to establish real-world times for the packets, and their positions, we need to
# interpolate the asynchronous packets for this information against the elapsed times for
# the variables on interest.  This class provides facilities to register one or more named
# dependent variables (and automatically adds an independent variable), which can be added
# to as data becomes available.  Interpolation can then be done at given time points against
# one or more of the dependent variables, returned as a list of NumPy arrays.

class InterpTable:
    ## Constructor, specifying the names of the dependent variables to be interpolated
    #
    # This sets up for interpolation of an independent variable (added automatically) against
    # the named dependent variables.
    #
    # \param vars   (Collection[str]) list|tuple|etc. of the names of the dependent variables to manage
    def __init__(self, vars: Collection[str]) -> None:

        for v in vars:
            self.vars[v] = []
    
    ## Add a data point to a single dependent variable
    #
    # Add a single data point to a single dependent variable.  Note that if the object is
    # tracking more than one dependent variable, this is likely to cause a problem, since
    # you'll have one more point in the independent variable array than in the dependent
    # variables that aren't updated by this call, which will fail interpolation.  This is
    # therefore only really useful for the special case where there is only a single
    # dependent variable being tracked.

    ## Add a data point to multiple dependent variables simultaneously
    #
    # Add a data point for one or more dependent variables at a common independent variable
    # point.  Since adding a data point for a common independent variable value to some, but
    # not all of the dependent variables would result in some dependent variables having arrays
    # of different lengths, it would cause problems when interpolating.  This is therefore only
    # really useful if you're updating all of the variables.

    # \param ind    Independent variable value to add to the array

    # \param values Collection list|tuple|etc. of values to update for the named dependent variables, in the same order
