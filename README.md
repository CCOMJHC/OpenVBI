## Installation
### Local installation

```pip install .```

### Running in a VS Code dev container
You will need docker installed to use the dev container. There is more info
on the specific prerequisites [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).
Once you have docker installed, open the project in `vscode` and select "Dev
Container: Reopen in Container" from the command palette. Once the container is
built and running, you can open a terminal with access to it in `vscode` and
your environment will be set up.
